# PS5

This is a basic script to check PS5 availability across a few web stores. 

The script does not actually purchase any PS5 consoles, it only sends email and text alerts to users via Twilio. 

The script was developed quickly, and is a first attempt at creating a bot. Needs work, but it was handy. 

It was developed in November 2020 and has not been maintained (PS5 secured).
